## **Art Style**

Battle Mode uses a **full-color 2D fighting game aesthetic** inspired by Street Fighter / Capcom arcade fighter style \- this is completely different from the 4-color Game Boy look of the Home Dashboard.

**Visual characteristics:**

* **Landscape orientation** (vs. portrait for home screen)  
* **Full-color palette** \- NOT limited to the DMG 4-color palette  
* **SF2-style combat UI**: Health bars, round timer, and energy meter styled after classic arcade fighters  
* **Character sprites**: Six playable Champions (purely cosmetic \- all have identical stats) with distinct fighting styles
