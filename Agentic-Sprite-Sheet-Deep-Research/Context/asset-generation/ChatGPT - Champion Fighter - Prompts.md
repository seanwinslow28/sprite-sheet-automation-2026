## **1\) Sean – Caucasian Male MMA Fighter**

A 2D fighting game character sprite in **modern-retro Street Fighter / Capcom arcade fighter style**, standing in a ready MMA combat stance. Full-body view on a 128×128 pixel canvas, side-facing three-quarter angle showing both fighting posture and outfit details.

Sean is a **Caucasian male professional MMA fighter** with a strong athletic build. Light peach skin (**\#F5D6C6**), short slightly messy dirty-blonde hair (**\#C2A769**), and steel blue eyes (**\#4682B4**). His expression is focused and confident, like a seasoned fighter about to enter a bout. Brows slightly furrowed, jaw set, eyes locked forward.

He wears an off-white sleeveless athletic tank (**\#F2F0EF**) that fits snugly around his torso, showing clear shoulder and chest definition. The tank has subtle pixel-cluster shading to indicate fabric folds and stretch, but no logos. His gym pants are neon blue (**\#2323FF**), slightly loose but clearly athletic, with a simple elastic waistband and minimal seam details so the silhouette reads cleanly. Shoes are low-profile white training sneakers (**\#F5F5F5**) with solid black soles (**\#272929**), drawn with 2–3 tones to show form and grounding.

**Stance:** classic MMA ready stance. Feet shoulder-width apart, back leg slightly behind, both heels lightly off the ground. Knees bent in an explosive, balanced posture. Torso rotated slightly toward the camera to show both chest and back shoulder. Both fists raised in a high guard: front hand slightly extended, back hand closer to the jaw. Elbows tucked but visible. Head slightly tucked, eyes forward. The overall pose should feel like the **idle stance on a fighting-game character select screen**—tense, ready, but not mid-attack.

**Pixel art style:**  
 Modern-retro **16-bit fighting-game pixel art** with realistic proportions (not chibi). Use **clean dark outlines** around the silhouette and darker local colors for interior lines. No noisy dithering—rely on **solid pixel clusters** with 3–4 tones per major color (skin, tank, pants, hair, shoes). Light source from the **upper-front**, casting shadows under the jaw, under the arms, and along the inner legs. Add subtle highlights on shoulders, upper chest, and top edges of the pants to emphasize form.

Canvas: **128×128**, Sean fills roughly **100–110 pixels tall**, leaving minimal empty space around him. Background is **pure white (\#FFFFFF)** with an optional tiny soft gray ground shadow under the feet for grounding.

## **2\) Mary – Caucasian Female Kickboxing Trainer**

A 2D fighting game character sprite in **modern-retro Capcom-style pixel art**, 128×128 canvas, full-body, three-quarter side view.

Mary is a **Caucasian female kickboxing trainer** with an athletic, empowering build. Light peach skin (**\#F5D6C6**), medium brown hair tied back in a practical athletic ponytail (**\#6D4C41**), and warm brown eyes (**\#654321**). Her expression is confident and encouraging—slight determined smile, brows angled with focus, like a trainer who can both coach and fight.

She wears a pink athletic tank/sports-bra style top (**\#FF7BAC**), fitted and supportive, with clear shoulder and upper-arm definition. The top is shaded with 3–4 tones to show curvature of the chest and the stretch of the fabric. Her workout shorts are purple (**\#7E57C2**), mid-thigh length, with a simple waistband and subtle folds around the hips and knees. She has a deep purple athletic headband (**\#9C27B0**) that keeps her hair back, rendered with a thin highlight along the top edge. Shoes are clean white trainers (**\#F5F5F5**) with slightly darker soles and minimal detailing to keep the silhouette readable.

**Stance:** determined kickboxing stance. One leg slightly raised, knee bent, prepared to kick—this raised leg should be clear but still feel like an idle, held pose rather than mid-motion blur. The supporting leg is firmly planted with a slight bend in the knee. Torso leans slightly forward in a ready posture. Fists are up in guard at cheek height, elbows angled inward but readable. Her body angle conveys readiness and balance, not aggression.

**Pixel art style:**  
 Same **modern-retro fighting-game pixel style**: realistic but stylized anatomy, strong silhouette, clean dark outlines. Use **3–4 tones** for skin, hair, top, shorts, and shoes. Light source from **upper-front** with highlights on shoulders, upper thigh, and headband, and shadows under the raised leg and under the chin. No dithering; rely on solid pixel clusters and mild anti-aliasing along curved areas (face, arms, raised leg).

Canvas: **128×128**, Mary is \~100–110 px tall. Background: **\#FFFFFF** with a tiny elliptical gray shadow beneath the grounded foot to anchor her.

Warm brown skin (**\#8D5524**), short black athletic hair (**\#212121**), and dark brown determined eyes (**\#4A4A4A**). His expression carries calm confidence and leadership—a slight smirk or focused look that feels motivational, like he’s encouraging students while ready to throw down.

He wears a dark gray athletic tank (**\#545454**) that fits snugly, clearly outlining his chest, shoulders, and arms. Pants are light gray athletic pants (**\#C4BEBB**), slightly tapered at the ankles, with subtle knee folds and hip shading.

His gloves are **bright gold boxing gloves** (**\#FFD700**), slightly reflective and bold. Use 3–4 tones on the gloves: deep gold shadow, mid gold, bright gold highlight, and a near-white specular highlight on the top edges to make them pop.

**Stance:** confident boxer stance. Feet staggered, knees bent, solid base. Torso angled toward the viewer, chest open but guarded. Both gold gloves raised in a professional boxing guard: front glove slightly extended, rear glove close to the jaw. Elbows in, shoulders engaged. The overall posture radiates “coach who can still absolutely handle himself”—solid, grounded, and charismatic.

**Pixel art style:**  
 Modern-retro **16-bit fighting-game sprite**, realistic proportions, no chibi. Strong dark outline around the silhouette; internal lines (muscles, clothing folds, glove seams) use darker local colors instead of pure black to keep things refined. **3–4 tone shading** on skin, tank, pants, gloves, and shoes, with light source from **upper-front**. Accentuate deltoids, biceps, and chest with curved highlight clusters, and place deeper shadows under the arms and between the legs. No dithering; clean pixel clusters and subtle anti-aliasing on round forms.

Canvas: **128×128**, Marcus roughly **100–110 px tall**. Background: **pure white (\#FFFFFF)** with a small soft gray ground shadow beneath his feet.

## **4\) Aria – Latina Female Dance Combat Instructor**

A 2D fighting game character sprite in **modern-retro pixel art**, blending fighting-game readability with a fluid capoeira/dance vibe. Full-body, 128×128 canvas, three-quarter side view.

Aria is a **Latina female capoeira/dance combat instructor** with a flexible, athletic build and a sense of rhythm in her posture. Warm tan skin (**\#C68642**), dark brown hair tied back for movement (**\#4B3621**)—a high or mid ponytail or bun with a few subtle motion curves—and dark green vibrant eyes (**\#06402B**). Her expression is bright and focused, conveying both joy and intensity—like she’s performing while ready to strike.

She wears a magenta dance/athletic top (**\#9A2257**), fitted like a dance crop top or sports top, with shading emphasizing ribcage and shoulder curvature. Her pants are blue, flowing athletic pants (**\#5577AA**), looser than typical fighters: wide legs with visible folds and flowing shapes to show movement, but still clean enough to animate. She has white flexible athletic shoes (**\#F5F5F5**) with thin soles, suited for dance and capoeira, shaded with 2–3 tones.

**Stance:** dynamic capoeira-style pose. One leg extended in a fluid, arcing motion—either a high side kick or a sweeping arc—but captured in a **stable, readable frame**, not a blur. The supporting leg is firmly grounded with a bent knee. Torso leans slightly away from or into the extended leg, showcasing core strength and balance. One arm extended gracefully for balance, the other bent in a guarding or expressive posture. The pose should feel rhythmic and dance-like but still clearly “combat ready.”

**Pixel art style:**  
 Same **modern-retro 16-bit fighting-game style**: realistic proportions, strong silhouette, clean outline. Use **3–4 tones** for skin, top, pants, hair, and shoes. Let the pants have clear, flowing shading: lighter tones on outer curves and darker tones in folds near the knees and inner leg. Light source from **upper-front**, with highlights on shoulders, extended leg, and top edge of the magenta top. No dithering—flow is suggested via larger pixel clusters, curve-friendly anti-aliasing, and overlapping shapes.

Canvas: **128×128**, Aria around **100–110 px tall**, leg extension arranged so she fits nicely in frame. Background: **\#FFFFFF**, with a small gray ground shadow under the planted foot.

 Same **modern-retro 16-bit fighting-game style** as the others, ensuring consistency across the roster.
