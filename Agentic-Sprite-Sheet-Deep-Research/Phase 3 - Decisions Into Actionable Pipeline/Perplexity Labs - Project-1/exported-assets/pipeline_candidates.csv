Pipeline Name,Required Components,Best At,Drift Risks,Automation Viability,Evidence Links (Count)
LoRA + DWPose + ComfyUI,SD1.5/SDXL + Character LoRA + DWPose + ComfyUI,"Anchor-locked fidelity, proven workflows, full control",Low (LoRA locks identity); pose skeleton errors possible,"Yes (ComfyUI API, Python, headless execution)","8+ (ChatGPT, Perplexity, Gemini reports)"
IP-Adapter Plus + DWPose,SDXL + IP-Adapter Plus + DWPose + Rembg,"Zero-shot speed, no training, batch NPC generation",Medium (fine details fluctuate); CLIP embeddings spatial imprecision,"Yes (ComfyUI API, no training step, batch-friendly)","6+ (Stable Diffusion Art, Hugging Face)"
3D-Assisted (Mixamo + Blender),TripoAI + Blender + Mixamo + ControlNet (Depth/Line),"Pose precision, deterministic output, 100+ animations",Low drift (3D guarantees pose); stylization can introduce artifacts,"Partial (Blender Python scripting, Mixamo manual export)","5+ (Reddit r/aigamedev, YouTube tutorials)"
Animate Anyone (Fine-tuned),Animate Anyone (2-stage fine-tune) + DWPose + L40S GPU,"Temporal coherence, research-grade quality, spatial detail",Very Low (fine-tuned on anchors); Stage 2 overfitting → detail loss,"Partial (inference scriptable, training manual curation)","2+ (arXiv paper, ChatPaper analysis)"
Flux Dev + LoRA + DWPose,Flux Dev + Pixel Art LoRA + DWPose + 40GB VRAM,"High-res pixel art, instruction-following, constraint adherence",Low (LoRA + prompt constraints); over-constraining reduces flexibility,"Yes (ComfyUI API, but LoRA training per-character)","3+ (LinkedIn, YouTube)"
SDXL + IP-Adapter + Multi-ControlNet,SDXL + IP-Adapter + DWPose + HED/Depth ControlNet,"Flexibility, widely documented, easy prototyping",Medium-High (no identity lock without LoRA); SDXL style richness conflicts pixel art,"Yes (ComfyUI API, Diffusers library, widely supported)","5+ (ComfyUI docs, Stable Diffusion Art)"
AnimateDiff + ControlNet,AnimateDiff Module + ControlNet (OpenPose/HED) + LCM LoRA,"Smooth temporal transitions, walkrun cycles, video output",Medium (temporal module helps); limited 16-32 frame context,"Partial (complex VRAM management, 16-32 frame batches)","4+ (AiTuts, Sandner.art, Reddit)"
Ludo.ai Pose Editor (SaaS),Ludo.ai subscription + web interface (no local setup),"Minutes-to-sheet, integrated sound, no ML knowledge",Medium (black-box model); loops not always perfect,"No (web UI only, no public API, subscription)","2+ (Ludo.ai blog, user reports)"
Zero-Shot Dual-Pass (IP + Face Fix),IP-Adapter Plus + DWPose + Face inpainting workflow,"Fast iteration, no LoRA, rapid prototyping",Medium (IP-Adapter ~90% consistency); face/body seam risk,"Yes (ComfyUI dual-pass workflow, scriptable)","4+ (Reddit, YouTube, Stable Diffusion Art)"
Hybrid Anchor-First (IP→LoRA),IP-Adapter + DWPose (gen dataset) → LoRA training,"Cold-start solution, best of both worlds (IP + LoRA)",Low (LoRA trained on IP output); dataset quality critical,"Yes (automated IP→LoRA pipeline, one-time per character)","5+ (ChatGPT report, Perplexity synthesis)"
Character Sheet + LoRA Retrain,SDXL + Character Sheet prompt + LoRA training (2 rounds),"Flexible LoRAs, cross-style, iterative refinement",Low (iterative LoRA refinement); labor-intensive curation,"Partial (requires multiple training runs, manual cropping)","4+ (Everly Heights, Cobalt Explorer)"
PuLID + ACE + DWPose,PuLID/ACE face encoder + DWPose + ControlNet,"Near-perfect face ID, better than IP-Adapter for faces",Low-Medium (face excellent); mirrors reference pose too closely,"Yes (ComfyUI nodes, scriptable, face detection automated)","5+ (YouTube, Reddit r/comfyui, MyAIForce)"
