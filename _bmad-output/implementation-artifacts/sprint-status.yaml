# STATUS DEFINITIONS:
# ==================
# Epic Status:
#   - backlog: Epic not yet started
#   - in-progress: Epic actively being worked on
#   - done: All stories in epic completed
#
# Story Status:
#   - backlog: Story only exists in epic file
#   - ready-for-dev: Story file created in stories folder

#
# WORKFLOW NOTES:
# ===============
# - Epic transitions to 'in-progress' automatically when first story is created
# - Stories can be worked in parallel if team capacity allows
# - SM typically creates next story after previous one is 'done' to incorporate learnings
# - Dev moves story to 'review', then runs code-review (fresh context, different LLM recommended)
#
# AI AGENT ASSIGNMENTS:
# ====================
# Each story is assigned an AI agent based on Terminal Agents + BMAD Strategy:
#   - claude-code: Complex architecture, multi-file refactoring, state machines
#   - codex-cli: Well-defined features, autonomous 2-8 hour builds
#   - gemini-cli: Fast prototypes, large context analysis, debugging
#   - cursor: UI components, frontend work, real-time visual feedback
